# etch-a-sketch

**Live demo:** https://berto-m.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

I am not a UI designer, so I like to take inspiration from other creators. Cloning projects from creators that are better than me, forces me think hard and google a lot. This time I tried to clone the project from:

- https://michalosman.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

## Features 
- **Color picker:** html styled color picker.
- **Random Color Mode:** it randomizes the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely.
- **Darkening effect:** if a square already has a color, it darkens the color by 10% when it's hovered or clicked
- **Clear:** The clear button deletes the background property from the DOM.
- **Reset:** The reset button clears entire grid without re-adjusting the size.
- **Grid Size Adjustment:** uses a slider to adjust the grid size from 1 to 100

## Feedback
